    "- In my experiment, the CSV file size was 32.86 MB while the Parquet file was only 7.03 MB. CSV stores data in plain text format, where each row is written sequentially and values are separated by commas. This means numbers and categories are stored as readable text which increases file size and requires more disk reading."
